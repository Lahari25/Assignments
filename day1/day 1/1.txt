1.  Study about System.Object  class in .NET Framework?

System.Object class :
-The .NET Base Class Library(BCL) has a language-specific alias which is Object class with the fully qualified name as System.Object. 
-Every class in C# is directly or indirectly derived from the Object class. 
-If a class does not extend any other class then it is the direct child class of the Object class and if extends another class then it is indirectly derived. 
-Therefore the Object class methods are available to all C# classes. 
-Hence Object class acts as a root of the inheritance hierarchy in any C# Program. 
-The main purpose of the Object class is to provide low-level services to derived classes.
